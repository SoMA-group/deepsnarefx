DeepAFx: Differentiable Signal Processing with Black-Box Audio Effects
=========================


The enclosed **DeepAFx** files are a collection of trained Tensorflow (Keras) models that can be used together with LV2 audio plugins to perform three different intelligent audio processing tasks including tube amplifier distortion emulation, automatic non-speech sound removal, and automatic music mastering. For technical details of the work, please see our code and the following paper:


"Differentiable Signal Processing with Black-Box Audio Effects." Marco A. Martínez Ramírez, Oliver Wang, Paris Smaragdis, and Nicholas J. Bryan. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2021.

When our code and/or models are used for academic research, we would highly appreciate it if scientific publications of works partly based on this work cite the paper above.
